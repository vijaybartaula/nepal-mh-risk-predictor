## üß† Overview

The Mental Health Risk Predictor is a data-driven tool designed to estimate potential mental health risk levels in Nepal based on social determinants of health (SDOH). This application analyzes socioeconomic factors and lifestyle data to generate a personal risk assessment on a 0-10 scale, where higher scores indicate potentially greater vulnerability to mental health issues.

## Key Features

- **Personalized Risk Assessment**: Generate an individualized mental health risk score based on your specific socioeconomic profile.
- **Evidence-Informed Recommendations**: Receive tailored suggestions based on your risk profile and contributing factors.
- **Visual Analytics**: Explore the relationships between different socioeconomic factors and mental health risk through interactive visualizations.
- **Educational Resources**: Learn about the social determinants affecting mental health in the Nepal context.
- **Privacy-Focused**: All data processing happens locally on your device with no external data storage.

## Social Determinants Analyzed

The predictor evaluates the following factors:

- Income level (NPR)
- Employment status
- Education level
- Housing quality
- Social isolation
- Healthcare access
- Community support
- Physical activity

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vijaybartaula/nepal-mh-risk-predictor.git
   cd mental-health-risk-predictor
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Launch the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:8501`

## üìñ Usage Guide

1. **Input Your Data**: Use the sidebar sliders and dropdown menus to enter your socioeconomic profile.
2. **Generate Prediction**: Click the "Predict Mental Health Risk" button to calculate your risk score.
3. **Review Results**: Examine your risk score and personalized recommendations.
4. **Explore Relationships**: Toggle the visualization options to better understand how different factors affect mental health risk.

## üß™ Model Information

The core prediction engine uses a multiple linear regression model trained on a synthetic dataset that mirrors expected societal patterns in Nepal. While not trained on clinical data, the model incorporates realistic correlations based on global mental health research and Nepal-specific socioeconomic contexts.

The risk equation is a weighted sum of standardized inputs:

```
Risk Score = Œ≤‚ÇÄ + Œ≤‚ÇÅ√óIncome + Œ≤‚ÇÇ√óEmployment + Œ≤‚ÇÉ√óEducation + Œ≤‚ÇÑ√óHousing + 
             Œ≤‚ÇÖ√óIsolation + Œ≤‚ÇÜ√óHealthcare + Œ≤‚Çá√óCommunity + Œ≤‚Çà√óPhysical_Activity
```

Where Œ≤·µ¢ are the coefficients derived from our regression analysis.

## üìù Important Notes

- This tool is for **educational and informational purposes only**.
- It is **not a clinical diagnostic tool** and should not replace professional medical advice.
- The model is based on synthetic data informed by research but not validated in clinical settings.
- Risk scores should be interpreted as relative indicators rather than absolute assessments.
