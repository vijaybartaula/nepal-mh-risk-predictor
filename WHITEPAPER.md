# Mental Health Risk Predictor for Nepal:
# A Social Determinants of Health Approach

*Mental Health Initiative Nepal*

*May 2025*

---

## Executive Summary

This whitepaper introduces the Mental Health Risk Predictor, a novel computational tool designed to estimate individual mental health vulnerability in Nepal based on social determinants of health (SDOH). Mental health disorders affect approximately 20-25% of Nepal's population, yet access to mental health services remains severely limited with fewer than 2 mental health professionals per 100,000 people. Our solution addresses a critical need for early identification of at-risk individuals to enable preventive interventions and resource allocation.

The predictor leverages a multiple regression model that analyzes eight key socioeconomic factors, generating a comprehensive risk score on a scale of 0-10. While not intended as a clinical diagnostic tool, this system provides valuable insights for community health workers, policymakers, NGOs, and individuals to better understand and address mental health vulnerabilities within Nepal's unique cultural and economic context.

## 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Mental health disorders represent a significant public health challenge in Nepal, affecting an estimated one-fifth to one-quarter of the population. Despite this high prevalence, the country faces severe limitations in mental health infrastructure, with an acute shortage of mental health professionals, inadequate facilities, and limited awareness about mental health issues.

The Mental Health Risk Predictor represents an innovative approach to addressing these challenges by:

1. Providing a data-driven tool for identifying individuals who may be at heightened risk for mental health challenges
2. Emphasizing prevention and early intervention rather than treatment alone
3. Supporting more efficient allocation of limited mental health resources
4. Increasing awareness of the social determinants that influence mental wellbeing
5. Empowering individuals with personalized insights and recommendations

This whitepaper outlines the development, methodology, implementation, and potential applications of the Mental Health Risk Predictor within the Nepalese context.

## 2. Background and Context <a name="background-and-context"></a>

### 2.1 Mental Health in Nepal

Nepal faces significant mental health challenges shaped by multiple factors:

- **Economic conditions**: Approximately 18.7% of Nepal's population lives below the poverty line, with economic insecurity strongly correlated with mental health issues.
- **Natural disasters**: The 2015 earthquake and subsequent disasters have contributed to high rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression.
- **Political instability**: A decade-long civil war (1996-2006) and ongoing political transitions have created psychosocial pressures across communities.
- **Stigma**: Mental health issues remain highly stigmatized, preventing many from seeking care.
- **Infrastructure limitations**: Nepal has fewer than 2 psychiatrists and 0.25 psychologists per 100,000 people, significantly below WHO recommendations.

### 2.2 Social Determinants of Health Framework

The Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) framework recognizes that health outcomes are significantly influenced by the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age. These determinants include:

- Economic stability
- Education access and quality
- Healthcare access and quality
- Neighborhood and built environment
- Social and community context

Research consistently demonstrates that these factors have profound impacts on mental health outcomes, often exceeding the influence of individual behavioral choices or genetic predispositions.

### 2.3 Existing Approaches and Gaps

Current approaches to mental health risk assessment in Nepal include:

- **Clinical screening tools**: While effective, these require trained professionals to administer and interpret.
- **Self-report questionnaires**: These provide limited context and may not capture underlying social determinants.
- **Community-based surveillance**: Often lacks systematic data collection and analysis capabilities.

Our Mental Health Risk Predictor aims to bridge these gaps by providing an accessible, socially-contextualized tool that can be used at scale without extensive clinical training.

## 3. Theoretical Framework <a name="theoretical-framework"></a>

### 3.1 Integrated Conceptual Model

The Mental Health Risk Predictor is built upon an integrated conceptual model that synthesizes three key theoretical frameworks:

1. **Social Determinants of Health (SDOH)**: Recognizes the profound impact of social, economic, and environmental factors on health outcomes.

2. **Stress-Vulnerability Model**: Acknowledges that mental health disorders arise from interactions between biological vulnerabilities and environmental stressors.

3. **Capabilities Approach**: Emphasizes that wellbeing depends on individuals' capabilities to achieve valuable functionings within their societal context.

### 3.2 Selected Determinants and Their Pathways

Based on extensive literature review and contextual analysis specific to Nepal, we identified eight key determinants with established pathways to mental health outcomes:

1. **Income**: Financial resources determine access to basic necessities, healthcare, education, and create or alleviate chronic stress.

2. **Employment Status**: Beyond income, employment provides structure, purpose, social connections, and identity. Unemployment and precarious employment correlate strongly with depression and anxiety.

3. **Education Level**: Higher education levels correlate with improved mental health through multiple pathways including better health literacy, employment opportunities, and problem-solving skills.

4. **Housing Quality**: Inadequate housing creates physical stressors (overcrowding, noise, poor sanitation) and psychological stressors (shame, insecurity, fear).

5. **Social Isolation**: Social connections provide emotional support, practical resources, and buffer against stressors. Isolation is particularly relevant in Nepal's collectivist culture.

6. **Healthcare Access**: Preventive care, early intervention, and treatment of physical conditions all contribute to mental wellbeing.

7. **Community Support**: Strong community connections provide resources, identity, and meaning that support mental health resilience.

8. **Physical Activity**: Regular physical activity has well-documented neurobiological and psychological benefits for mental health.

## 4. Methodology <a name="methodology"></a>

### 4.1 Data Sources and Development

The Mental Health Risk Predictor model was developed using a synthetic dataset based on patterns observed in:

1. **Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS)**: Provides baseline demographic data and health indicators.

2. **Nepal Living Standards Survey (NLSS)**: Offers detailed socioeconomic indicators across different regions and populations.

3. **World Health Organization (WHO) STEPwise Approach to NCD Risk Factor Surveillance**: Provides data on behavioral risk factors.

4. **Published research literature**: Academic studies on mental health correlates in Nepal and similar low and middle-income countries.

We generated a synthetic dataset of 300 individuals that preserves the statistical relationships observed in these real-world data sources while avoiding privacy concerns.

### 4.2 Feature Engineering

Each of the eight determinants was operationalized as follows:

1. **Income_NPR**: Annual household income in Nepalese Rupees.
2. **Employment**: Categorical variable (0=Employed, 1=Unemployed, 2=Student, 3=Retired).
3. **Education**: Ordinal variable (0=No formal education, 1=High School, 2=Bachelor's, 3=Master's, 4=Doctorate).
4. **Housing**: 10-point scale measuring housing quality and stability.
5. **Isolation**: 10-point scale measuring degree of social isolation.
6. **Healthcare**: 10-point scale measuring healthcare access and quality.
7. **Community**: 10-point scale measuring community support.
8. **Physical_Activity**: Continuous variable measuring days of physical activity per week.

### 4.3 Model Development

We developed a multiple linear regression model to predict mental health risk scores:

1. **Data preprocessing**: Features were standardized using a standard scaler to ensure comparability across different scales.

2. **Model training**: The linear regression model was trained on the synthetic dataset, optimizing for predictive accuracy while maintaining interpretability.

3. **Model validation**: Cross-validation techniques were employed to assess model robustness and prevent overfitting.

4. **Coefficient extraction**: The trained model's coefficients were extracted to form the basis of the prediction equation.

## 5. The Mental Health Risk Predictor Model <a name="the-mental-health-risk-predictor-model"></a>

### 5.1 Prediction Equation

The core prediction equation takes the form:

```
Risk Score = β₀ + β₁×(Income_NPR) + β₂×(Employment) + β₃×(Education) + 
             β₄×(Housing) + β₅×(Isolation) + β₆×(Healthcare) + 
             β₇×(Community) + β₈×(Physical_Activity)
```

Where:
- β₀ is the intercept term
- β₁ through β₈ are the coefficients representing the relative impact of each determinant
- All input variables are standardized (z-scores) before entering the equation

### 5.2 Coefficient Interpretation

The model coefficients reveal several important insights:

1. **Income** demonstrates a negative relationship with risk, with lower income predicting higher mental health vulnerability.

2. **Social Isolation** shows one of the strongest positive associations with risk, highlighting the importance of social connections in Nepalese culture.

3. **Healthcare Access** has a moderate negative association with risk, indicating that better healthcare access correlates with improved mental health outcomes.

4. **Community Support** exhibits a notable negative relationship with risk, reinforcing the protective effects of community embeddedness.

5. **Employment Status** shows varying effects depending on the category, with unemployment demonstrating the strongest positive association with risk.

### 5.3 Risk Score Interpretation

The final risk score ranges from 0 to 10, with the following interpretive guidelines:

- **0-3**: Low risk - Current social determinants suggest good protection against mental health challenges
- **4-7**: Moderate risk - Some concerning factors present; preventive measures recommended
- **8-10**: High risk - Multiple significant risk factors present; professional support may be beneficial

## 8. Limitations and Ethical Considerations <a name="limitations-and-ethical-considerations"></a>

### 8.1 Model Limitations

We acknowledge several important limitations:

1. **Synthetic data foundation**: While informed by real-world relationships, the model is not trained on actual clinical outcomes.

2. **Linear assumptions**: The model assumes linear relationships between predictors and outcomes, which may oversimplify complex interactions.

3. **Static nature**: The current implementation does not account for how risk factors may change over time or interact dynamically.

4. **Regional variation**: Nepal's diverse geography and cultures may mean that risk factors vary in importance across different regions.

5. **Limited scope**: Some potentially important determinants (e.g., discrimination, political instability) are not currently included.

### 8.2 Ethical Considerations

Several ethical considerations guided development and deployment:

1. **Non-stigmatizing language**: The application avoids potentially stigmatizing terminology around mental health.

2. **Clear scope limitations**: The tool explicitly communicates that it is not a diagnostic instrument and does not replace professional care.

3. **Resource linking**: Users receiving high-risk scores are provided with information about available mental health resources.

4. **Equity focus**: Special attention was paid to ensuring the tool remains accessible across socioeconomic divides.
